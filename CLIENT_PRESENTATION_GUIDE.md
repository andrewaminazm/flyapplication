## 🎯 Address Common Client Concerns

### "Is it secure?"
**Answer**: Yes! Next.js is used by major companies (Netflix, Twitch, Nike). Free hosting providers (Vercel) include SSL certificates (the padlock in the browser). Your website is as secure as major corporate sites.

### "What if I need help?"
**Answer**: The admin panel is very intuitive - if you can use Facebook, you can use this. I can provide a quick 15-minute training. Plus, there's a detailed README guide included.

### "Can it grow with my business?"
**Answer**: Absolutely! Right now it uses a simple file for data (perfect for starting). Later, if you grow, we can add:
- Real booking system with calendar
- Payment processing (Stripe/PayPal)
- Database for thousands of destinations
- Customer accounts and login
- Email notifications
- Reviews and ratings
- Blog section

All without rebuilding from scratch.

### "How do I get images?"
**Answer**: Three options:
1. **Free stock photos**: Unsplash, Pexels (unlimited free travel images)
2. **Your own photos**: Upload to Imgur or similar, use the link
3. **Purchase**: iStock, Shutterstock (if you want exclusive images)

I can show you how to find and add image URLs in 2 minutes.

### "Can customers book directly?"
**Answer**: Right now, they'll click "Book Now" which you can link to your email or phone. For phase 2 (later), we can add:
- Online booking calendar
- Payment processing
- Automatic confirmations
- This keeps initial costs low, adds features when you're ready
