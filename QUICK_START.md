## 🎤 Answer Common Questions

### Q: "Is this really all it costs?"
**A**: "Yes! The website is built, hosting is free (Vercel/Netlify), you just need a domain name like yourcompany.com for $10-15. That's it."

### Q: "What if I mess something up?"
**A**: "You can't break anything! If you delete something by accident, I can restore it. Plus, every change is instant - if you don't like it, just change it back."

### Q: "Can I add more destinations later?"
**A**: "Absolutely! Add 10, 50, 100 destinations. There's no limit. You have complete freedom."

### Q: "How long to go live?"
**A**: "3 days maximum:
- Day 1: You give me your content (destinations, contact info)
- Day 2: I set up your domain and deploy
- Day 3: I train you on the admin (15 minutes)
- You're live!"

### Q: "What about booking and payments?"
**A**: "For now, customers click 'Book Now' and contact you directly (email/phone). This keeps costs at zero. Later, when you're ready, we can add online booking and payments for around $30/month. Start lean, grow smart."

### Q: "What if I need help?"
**A**: "I'll give you a 15-minute training, plus detailed guides with screenshots. It's very intuitive - if you can use Facebook, you can use this."
