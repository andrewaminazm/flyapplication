4. Check URL has `https://` not `http://`
5. Try different device/network

### "Images aren't loading"
1. Check your browser console (F12)
2. Verify `next.config.ts` has image domains
3. Redeploy if needed
4. Images may take 1-2 minutes after first deployment

### "Admin panel not working"
1. Make sure URL is exactly: `/admin` (no typo)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if API routes deployed (Vercel logs)
4. Try different browser

### "It looks different on my phone"
- This is normal - responsive design adapts
